ROIs in this repo are used for a 2AFC classification task for discriminating between 10 mm vs 20 mm clusters. The specks in each cluster are HA with size ranges:<br>
10 mm<sub>A</sub>: ~four specks 150-180 um, 3 specks 212-250 um <br>
10 mm<sub>B</sub>: ~seven specks 150-180 um, 3 specks 212-250 um <br>
20 mm<sub>A</sub>: ~eleven specks 150-180 um, 3 specks 212-250 um <br>
20 mm<sub>B</sub>: ~eighteen specks 150-180 um, 3 specks 212-250 um <br>

The number of total specks was scaled for 10 mm and 20 mm so as to keep the speck density approximately the same. The number of large specks was kept fixed to not tip off the reader.
